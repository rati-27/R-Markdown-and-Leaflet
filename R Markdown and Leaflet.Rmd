## Introduction

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

The rubric contains the following two questions:

1.The web page feature a date and  this date is less than two months before the date that you're grading this assignment.

2.The web page feature an interactive map that appears to have been created with Leaflet.

Leaflet is one of the most popular Javascript libraries for creating interactive maps. The leaflet R package allows you to create your own leaflet maps without needing to know any Javascript!


## Mapping Clusters
Sometimes you might have so many points on a map that it doesn't make sense to plot every marker. In these situations leaflet allows you to plot clusters of markers using addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()). When you zoom in to each cluster, the clusters will separate until you can see the individual markers.
```{r}
library(leaflet)
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(500, min = 39.25, max = 39.35),
                 lng = runif(500, min = -76.65, max = -76.55))
df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions())
```

## Adding Legends
Adding a legend can be useful if you have markers on your map with different colors:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(20, min = 39.25, max = 39.35),
                 lng = runif(20, min = -76.65, max = -76.55),
                 col = sample(c("red", "blue", "green"), 20, replace = TRUE),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircleMarkers(color = df$col) %>%
  addLegend(labels = LETTERS[1:3], colors = c("blue", "red", "green"))
